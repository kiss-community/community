[002] Usage 
________________________________________________________________________________

Refer to the manual pages and command help output.


[003] Packaging
________________________________________________________________________________

To build the manpages sphinx is needed. In kisslinux sphinx is not packaged.
So the files:

* zathura.1 
* zathurarc.5

have to be taken from somewhere. The maintainer has the following
possibilities:

* the package can be downloaded from a binary distribution. For example 
  Archlinux [0]. The package can be downloaded from the link 
  "Download from Mirror" in the box "Package Actions".
* if there are only few changes, the patches can be downloaded from github and
  applied to the files. [1]
