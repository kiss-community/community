Either 'eudev' or 'libudev-zero' must be installed for the 'udev loader' checks to work.

'CONFIG_USER_NS' MUST be set to 'Y' in your kernel configuration for the sandbox to work. \
If support for user namespaces is not available, the SUID sandbox should be built instead:

* Change the 'ninja' command to:
    ninja -C out/Release chrome chrome_sandbox
* Package the sandbox:
    install -Dm4755 out/Release/chrome_sandbox "\$1/usr/lib/chromium/chrome-sandbox"
