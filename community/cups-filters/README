[001] Installation
________________________________________________________________________________

cups-filters needs ghostscript with cups support. To keep ghostscript as 
light as possible, cups is not a dependency for ghostscript. In order to get
cups-filters functional, cups has to be installed first and then ghostcript. 
Ghostcript will then detect cups and it will be compiled with cups support. 
it can be done with

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                              |
|  $ kiss b cups ghostscript cups-filters                                      |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

If ghostscript has cups support, only cups-filters has to be installed

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                              |
|  $ kiss b cups-filters                                                       |
|                                                                              |
